Developed an embedded system consisting of microcontroller and 8 sensors for water monitoring and transferring the data to base station using MQTT.
<!-- Designed PCB layouts, selected components, and wrote firmware for the system, resulting in a reliable and efficient product.
Implemented MQTT protocol for remote control of the system and developed a testing procedure to evaluate performance.
Utilized Fusion 360 and SolidWorks to create 3D models of the system for visualization and simulation. -->
